# publications-list

HTML CSS and Javascript to interactively display select publications. The images are placeholders but (publisher license allowing) you can display some of your own select publications for a more interactive experience. See the code in action at my codepen [HERE!](https://codepen.io/neuro-myoung/pen/OJWYrRe) or check out the demo in the gif below.
